## About Me

I am a software engineer and cloud architect with over 12 years of experience, including a tenure at Amazon Web Services (AWS) where I specialized in building resilient, enterprise-grade systems. Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a focus on machine learning, my work sits at the intersection of robust cloud architecture and the emerging frontier of agentic AI.

I am particularly interested in the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and building tools that enable AI agents to safely and effectively interact with the physical and digital world. Whether it's developing autonomous security patching agents or integrating LLMs into creative software, I am driven by the challenge of moving AI from theoretical research into practical, production-ready applications.
